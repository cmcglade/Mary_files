	<p> Hi <?php echo $color[0];?>! I find it interesting to think about how our 
	identity might change if we had our mother's name. If your name 
	wasn't <?php echo $color[1];?>, but instead it was <?php echo $color[2];?>,
	 would your favourite colour still be <?php echo $color[3];?>? Would you 
	still live in <?php echo $color[4];?> ? </p>
